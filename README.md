# Operating System labs

This repository stores a collection of materials I used during learning [CSCI350 Introduction to Operating System](https://classes.usc.edu/term-20233/course/csci-350/) at USC:

- labs by CSCI350 are submodules named as `project-x-seansun-zichenly`, depending on the specific requirements of Free Response Question, they may be in the `project-frq` folder as an writeup or a separate folder named as `project-x-frq-Echomo-Xinyu`
- self attempt labs by MIT [6.1810](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2023/) as submodule named `MIT-xv6-public`
- `c-pointer-revision` contains my notes and example code when revising pointer concepts
- `ospp-exercise` contains my notes and code while reading the book [Operating System: Princples and Practices](https://ospp.cs.washington.edu/)
