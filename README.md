# Operating System labs

This repository stores a collection of my labs related to the course [CSCI350 Introduction to Operating System](https://classes.usc.edu/term-20233/course/csci-350/) at USC and they are submodules named as `project-x-seansun-zichenly`.

In addition, I have added my self-attempt result for MIT [6.1810](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2023/) as in the folder xv6-labs-2023.
